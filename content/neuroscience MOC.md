The first I remember of getting interested in neuroscience was when I was 13 and [went to see awakenings by my self when i was 13](went%20to%20see%20awakenings%20by%20my%20self%20when%20i%20was%2013.md).

The second major interest I took in it was when I at age 22 or so bought a 700 page text-book called "Neuroscience" (and read… well… some of it.)
