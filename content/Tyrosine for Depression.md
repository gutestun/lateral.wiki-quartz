[Amino Acids for Depression, Part II: How to Scrape Your Low Energy and Mood Off the Floor > Alternative Mental Health Solution](https://moodhealing.com/amino-acids-depression-part-ii/)

* Take L-Tyrosine or *DL-Phenylalanine* supplements 20 minutes before, or 1 1/2 hours after food with protein (these supplements are protein fragments, so if taken away foods with protein, they will work more effectively.)

* Buy 500 mg capsules of these supplements (the starting dose).

* **DAY 1**: Start with (1) 500 mg capsule right when you wake, four hours later (and possibly mid-afternoon.) If you find that taking the afternoon dose disrupts your sleep stop taking it and just do the two morning doses.) Notice how you feel throughout the day on this dose.
  
  **DAY 2**: increase to two 500mg capsules (1000 mg) at the same time intervals as Day 1. Pay attention to how you feel throughout the day Specifically, do you notice a reduction in the symptoms that you are taking the supplement to address (i.e depressed mood, fatigue, lack of motivation and pleasure,cravings for substances etc.)
  
  **DAY 3**: If after day 2, you felt nothing or better than you did on Day 1, then increase to 3 caps per dose (1500 mg), following the dosing schedule of Day 1.
  
  Continuing to increase your dose in 500 mg increments per dose until you see no improvement or feel worse with the increased dosage and back down to the last positive dose. **This will be your Tyrosine or DLPA dose**.
  
  If you are experiencing *no* benefit after going up to 3000 mg each dose, I would assume that it will not be helpful to go any higher. At this point switch to the amino acid you have not tried yet and repeat the dosing process starting at the beginning. If you have tried both, consider other interventions besides amino acids to raise the CATS.
