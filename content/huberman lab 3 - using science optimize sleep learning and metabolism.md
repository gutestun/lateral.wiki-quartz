Resetting the circadian clock with window light will take 50-100x the time of direct sunlight.  
Glasses and lenses are ok though, because they focus the light

* For the first few hrs of the day you can sum the photon activation, meaning any light will modify the circadian clock.
* Mid-day is a circadian dead-zone, where no light will modify the circadian clock.
* In the evening the sensitivity to ligth goes way up, so be careful with light in the evening.

Suicide rates are higher in spring, not winter. 
Suicide often happens not at the bottom of the depression but when they start to emerge, as they come out of torpor and gain more energy and motivation.

melatonin is made from serotonin
