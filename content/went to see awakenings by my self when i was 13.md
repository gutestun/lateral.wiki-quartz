I can't quite remember why, but when I was 13 I went to see the movie Awakenings by my self. Whether I was motivated by a budding interest in invisible head-insides or if the story itself sparked it I can not account for. 

It made an impact though. Part of the budding of my interest in [neuroscience](neuroscience%20MOC.md).
