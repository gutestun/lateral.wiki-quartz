## TL;DR

*../nutraceutical* that helps with memory and alertness. Precursor to *../../www-old2/dopamine*.

## Effects, Use

I trust *../Andrew Huberman*, so I am listing his effects and benefits first. He is a neurologist with a PhD after all, and uses tyrosine himself. He praises tyrosine for:

* production of *../../www-old2/dopamine*
  Which would naturally lead us to expect:
* Increase in mood
* Increase in alertness (slight crash after use according to Huberman)

Trials have used 150mg/kg, which for me would med approximately 12g per day. Currently (2021-04) I am taking ca. 3-4g a day.

Required intake of (dietary) tyrosine has been estimated to be between 14mg/kg to 39mg/kg of body weight.

In older individuals tyrosine has shown indications of *decreasing* cognitive performance.

### What's it Good For?

* Memory
* Thinking skills
  (cognitive function‚Ä¶ There's more scientifically valid nomenclature available for this other than "brain go gooder")
* Alertness when sleep deprived
  * One night's sleep deprivation, people stayed alert for 3hrs longer with tyrosine than without
  * Improved memory
  * Improved reasoning
* Thyroid function/hormone levels  
  During stress thyroid hormone levels can drop. Tyrosine might help replenish.

### üß†‚öô Brain Go Wawoom When:

\*Or: Reasons I'd want to include tyrosine in a daily supplement regimen..

* Multitasking and distractions (sound, noisy environment)  
  This is my job (digital marketing agency) all the time, every time, all the days.  
  Update 2021-11: No longer at an agency, and doing home office 80% of the time now.
* Sleep deprivation  
  My parenting life. All the days, every night.
* Harsh military training  
  See above. Pretty similar to agency work and parenting I'd say. Except that the army people are 18, and I am more than twice that age‚Ä¶
* Cold weather  
  I live in the Nordics.

### Tyrosine Does Nothing When?

* Under normal conditions  
  After considering the above points (when tyrosine *does do good*) I'd estimate that my daily life equates to 2 - 2.5 harsh military trainings. Chances that my brain could function closer to baseline with an added pinch of tyrosine seem good.

### Things We Thought Tyrosine Was Good for but Has no/negative Clinical Evidence:

* Withdrawal symptons (cocaine, alcohol)
* *ADHD* (oral administration)
* Athletic performance
* Depression (oral administration)

### ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We Don't Know for Sure:

* Narcolepsy
  *Evidence is only self-reported, anecdotal, no clinical/significant findings*

## Neurochemistry

Tyrosine is created from phenylalanine

Tyrosine ‚Üí *L-DOPA* ‚Üí *dopamine* ‚Üí *../../www-old2/norepinephrine* ‚Üí *../epinephrine* 

This chain makes it a candidate for possibly helping with adhd as well, albeit evidence to the contrary.  
I also have a hypothesis that *../../www-old2/bupropion and tyrosine taken together potentiate each others effect*

About dosage and titration

N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine supposedly works better, but; a study showed it did not increase tyrosine levels at all.

### Uptake of l-Tyrosine ‚Äì Crossing the Blood Brain Barrier

Tyrosine needs help by way of

* an insulin mediated mechanism
* The proper carrier

### Foods Rich in Tyrosine

*These foods with carbs - will work well to get tyrosine into the brain*

* mustard greens
* watermelon
* pumpkin seeds
* chia seeds
* flaxseed
* almonds
* oats
